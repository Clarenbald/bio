            <p>Jacob tends to play video games a lot and this has rubbed off on me. At any point in time you will either find him playing on his desktop or Nintendo Switch. He get caught up in his games and often ignores people. This can lead to difficulty communicating and often some people feeling left out of his life. I often feel like this since he never really talks to me like he used to, but whenever we do talk I make the most of it and talk about the games he's playing. Some of the games he plays are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV:_A_Realm_Reborn">FFXIV: ARR</a> and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. He is always on his games and he is always improving. This just makes it even more fun when we are competing against each other. </p>

            <p>Always willing to give advice whenever I ask, he is the one I always go to for help in any situation. He listens carefully and is calm and collected. This is exactly what I want to be like. I always aspire to help and be giving advice to people. Most recently, he has helped me even with this website when he gave me the suggestion of splitting my typing up between each of the different topics. He was the first one who taught me any HTML and without him I wouldn’t be interested in creating websites. He has been like a beacon I have been following my entire life and now that I’m almost 18 I’m going to have to separate from him.</p>

            <div class="teach"><p>Jacob has always been a fantastic teacher. He helped me when I was struggling in school and he helped me when I was starting to lose interest in a lot of things. My time was always spent just sitting there struggling and when I finally decided to ask him for help, he quickly helped me and made sure I understood. He has been helping me with all of my problems since then. Even when creating this website, he helped me by correcting some of my code and even posing for some of the pictures. He always teaches me something new every day, whether it is how to do something or how to treat some people. He is my favorite teacher, no offense Ms. Sinclair.</p></div>

         <div class="col-8 offset-md-2">
            <p>There isn't much to say here; he is so lazy, at times it's funny. He can normally be found goofing off on his computer or sleeping. This has honestly become a norm in the house. We can all be a little lazy but Jacob and I always seem to be competing for who can be the laziest. We both play video games all the time and we both sleep a lot but I think he has me beat.  He, not very often, is so lazy that he doesn’t even sleep. This baffles me, and honestly I’m trying to break the habit of being lazy. My school work is suffering because of it and that isn’t good, I need to be better. In short, both he and I are lazy but I’m getting better.</p>
